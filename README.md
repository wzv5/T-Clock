**T-Clock Redux** in an enhanced fork of [Stoic Joker's T-Clock 2010](http://www.stoicjoker.com/TClock/)  
with ISO week number support, bug fixes and the ability to use Windows default calendar and ToolTip.

T-Clock *(called TClock)*, originally written by Kazubon in the early 90's, was a popular classic that was on the edge of extinction when Windows started going 64bit. ... Stoic Joker simply chose not to let that happen. And now it's up to us to continue their tale.
